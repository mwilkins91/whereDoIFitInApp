				<h2>Demographic Size</h2>
				<p>The size of your demographic can affect a number of things, not least of which is how much competition you might face when applying for schools, programs, or jobs. Population variation amongst different age or gender groups can also be linked with historical or cultural events, and you may be able to see if your generation was affected by significant events in your countries history.</p>
				<p>Look below to see how many other <span class="ageText">Age tag</span> year olds live in your country, and how many live in your comparison country. </p>

				<h2>Gender Population</h2>
				<p>In a state of nature, human populations would be very close to a 1:1 ratio of biological men to biological women. However in our modern world, many factors both past and present can push a countries gender balance from its natural state. These factors include war, high maternal mortality rates, or human intervention such as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">China's one child policy</a>.</p>
				<p>Look below and see how close your country is to its natural state of 1:1. Look at your comparison country, how close are they? If you see an imbalance, and you cannot think of an obvious reason for the imbalanced population, it may be worth looking into!</p>

				<h2>Global Distribution of <span class="ageText">age tag</span> Year Olds</h2>
				<p>It is important to consider that your generation is a global entity. Around the world, millions of other people were born the same year you were, and about half of them are they same gender as you as well.</p>
				<p>Consider that, while you may be separated by geography, many of these people may experience similar struggles to your own, while many others may live lives unlikes anything you could imagine. Take a look at the graph below to see how many <span class="ageText">age tag</span> year old <span class="genderText">gen tag</span>s are in each country around the world, and how small a fraction your own country makes up of the greater whole.</p>

				<h2>Global population and <span class="ageText">age tag</span> Year Olds.</h2>
				<p>Reflect on what we have learned so far, in that only a very small fraction of people born at the same time as you live in the same country as you. Think also of the fact that only half of that small fraction is also the same gender as you. Now consider that of the world's population, only a small fraction was born the same year you were.</p>
				<p>In the graph below, the colored section represents the entirety of the previous chart, as well as all of the members of the opposite gender also born in the same year as you.</p>
				<p>That means the colored section of the pie chart is many magnitudes of size larger than your demographic. If we were to render how small of a fraction your demographic makes up of the whole chart, it would not even be visible.</p>
				<div class="globalPopVsAge__container chart__container">
					<canvas id="globalPopVsAgeChart" class="globalPopVsAgeChart chart"></canvas>
				</div>
				<p>The facts that have been presented to you thus far have been based on essentially 3 facts you provided to us: your age, your home country, and your biological gender. We have established that based only on those, you represent such a small fraction of the world's population that we could not even render everyone like you on a graph.</p>
				<p>Consider also that there are far more factors than those three things that make up a person, and it may start to put things into perspective.</p>
				<p>We hope you have enjoyed this experience, and that you may recall it in the future when you hear about people from around the world, and that you might think about how different their lives might be from your own.</p>
